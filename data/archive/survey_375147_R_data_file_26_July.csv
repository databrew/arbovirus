The Hellenic National Public Health Organization (NPHO) receives immediate notification of all cases of Aedes-borne diseases diagnosed in the National Reference and other specialised laboratories conducting diagnostic testing for these viruses (through networking - direct interpersonal communication).
Regarding the awareness raising of physicians about the Aedes-borne arboviral diseases: The NPHO has provided guidelines for the recognition and diagnosis of Aedes-borne arboviral diseases, the recommended laboratory investigation, and the timely notification of cases (mailings and website www.eody.gov.gr), including the non-mandatory notification of all suspect cases to the NPHO. 
Informative letters were sent -on an almost annual basis- to all Health Units and Medical Associations of the country for awareness raising of the health-care workers for these diseases (for the timely diagnosis and notification of imported cases) - last letter sent in June 2021 . ","Success factors:
1) Enhancement of passive surveillance - Regular awareness raising of health-care workers for testing suspected cases.
2) Active surveillance (for West Nile virus infections: active laboratory-based surveillance for human cases, active surveillance in equids, and active vector surveillance are implemented in Greece) - Animal and vector surveillance data are used as early warnings/ alerts for the WNV circulation, for raising awareness of local health-care workers (for the diagnosis of human cases).
3) Enhancement of the laboratory capacity – Support of Reference and specialised laboratories - laboratory expertise and free-of-charge testing of suspect cases.
4) Multi-sectoral collaboration (national, regional and local level):
    - intersectoral National Committee/ advisory working groups
    - networks at national and local level, information flow - good interpersonal communication.
5) Action plans, established procedures, experience.
6) Free access to healthcare facilities (diagnosis, management).
7) Strong commitment of involved stakeholders and public health staff in their work and service.
8) Timeliness of communication, real-time information sharing.
9) Communication to health-care workers on the rationale of enhanced surveillance and the real-time use/ impact of surveillance data on the PH measures implemented (published surveillance outputs/ reports, timely implementation of response measures).

Challenges:
1) Human resources/ public health workforce at national and local level (high workload), Advocacy.
2) Coordination of One Health strategy for preparedness and response, at the policy level - integrated plan and coordination among sectors (public health + animal health + vector control).
3) Vector surveillance at national level (guidance, legislation, resources allocation, quality assessment).
4) Awareness of health-care workers for Arboviral diseases which have a very low incidence in the country or for imported cases of non-endemic diseases (regular awareness is needed).","A1","A1","100","100","A1","WNV, Dengue, Zika, Chikungunya, TBE, CCHF, Sandfly fevers.

The national public health authorities (NPHO/MoH) reimburse the testing for Arboviruses (in humans or mosquitoes, nationwide) in the National Reference Laboratory (for humans), in the Pasteur Institute (for humans), and in the Medical Entomology Unit of the School of Public Health - University of West Attica (for mosquitoes), and not the salary of the staff working in these laboratories for Arbovirus surveillance.

Veterinarians working at the national animal health authorities (Ministry of Rural Development and Food) are included in the “Epidemiologists” category, and laboratorians working at the national animal health authorities (for WNV testing of animals) are included in the ""Laboratorians"" category.

""Laboratorians"" include staff working/needed for either human (n=6.5/2), or animal (n=1.5/1) or mosquito (n=1/1) surveillance for pathogen (Arboviruses) detection in humans, animals or mosquitoes. 
""Entomologists"" (4,5 full time persons working in national authorities, and 12 more persons needed at national level, in total) include: i) medical entomologists (1,5 full time persons working in national authorities, and 6 more persons needed) and ii) laboratorians working for mosquito species identification (3 full time persons working in national authorities for mosquito identification, and 6 more persons needed).

Regarding Question 59: 
- In Greece there is full epidemiology and laboratory capacity for the Arboviruses surveillance in humans; however, this is achieved with a high workload of the available staff. So, in the question 59, the ideal number of staff persons needed is included (to maintain the full capacity with an adequate workload).
- Mosquito surveillance and control programmes are under the responsibility of regional and municipal authorities. NPHO/MoH and Benaki Phytopathological Institute (BPI)/Ministry of Rural Development and Food, in collaboration with other stakeholders (laboratory, regional authorities), also conduct active mosquito surveillance programmes in a limited scale. 
- As in Greece no Aedes-borne transmission has been recorded, Aedes circulation is routinely monitored in several areas in the context of the abovementioned mosquito surveillance programmes (and urgently around the recorded imported human cases of Aedes-borne diseases, if needed). 
The capacity on epidemiologists (for human and animal health sectors), entomologists/ vector control specialists and support staff only at the national level (in Ministries, NPHO, BPI) is included in this answer, and not at regional/local level, as the staff needed for capacity building at the regional/local level cannot be easily assessed at the national level.

In Greece, no recent local Aedes-borne transmission has been recorded so far. West Nile virus (WNV) infection cases are recorded -on an annual basis- in many European countries, including Greece. Since 2010, cases of WNV infection were recorded in various areas of Greece on an almost annual basis (in 2010-2014 and 2017-2020). This suggests that the WNV has been established in our country, as well as in other European and neighbouring countries. Therefore, the recurrence of WNV infection cases in our country and in other European and neighboring countries is considered likely and expected in each transmission period, during the mosquito circulation season. Thus, West Nile virus is of higher priority in Greece, than other Arboviruses (as only imported cases of DENV, ZIKV, CHIKV cases has been recorded, and a very limited number of locally acquired cases of other Arboviral diseases with tick-borne or sandfly-borne transmission).

Regarding question 18: Adequate testing of arboviral diseases is already performed in Greece (with a high workload of the available staff). In this question we have included additional resources needed to perform the (same) testing with a lower workload of the staff.

Regarding questions13 and 24 (about the training on Aedes-borne arboviral diseases): Only a few imported cases of Aedes-borne arboviral diseases have been recorded in Greece (among travelers). The Hellenic National Public Health Organization (NPHO) has provided guidelines for the recognition and diagnosis of Aedes-borne arboviral diseases and the recommended laboratory investigation. Informative material-letters were sent -on an almost annual basis- to all Health Units and Medical Associations of the country for awareness raising of the health-care workers for these diseases (for the timely diagnosis and management of imported cases of Dengue, Chikungunya and Zika virus infections) - last letter sent in early June 2021. In this material (letter), guidance is included regarding the diagnosis of the suspected cases, the case definition of suspected cases (cases under investigation), the clinical manifestations of these diseases, and some guidelines regarding the case management (e.g., mosquito protection of the infectious patients, warning signs for severe Dengue, avoidance of NSAIDs). No detailed/ analytical guidelines for the clinical treatment of cases/ severe cases were included in this material. This informative material will be also published on the NPHO' s website.
Furthermore, as WNV seasonal outbreaks occur in the country, the NPHO provides training for healthcare workers on the notification, diagnosis, and management of WNV disease - Awareness raising of physicians about the WNV infection: Testing for West Nile virus infection in suspected cases (such as cases with encephalitis, aseptic meningitis, acute flaccid paralysis, fever of undetermined etiology, especially during the transmission period) is recommended. The Hellenic National Public Health Organization provides guidelines for the recognition and diagnosis of WNV disease and the recommended laboratory investigation (mailings and website www.eody.gov.gr), and notification. On an annual basis, in the beginning of each transmission period (in May), an informative letter is sent to all Health Units and Medical Associations of the country for vigilance and awareness raising of the health-care workers regarding West Nile virus (including case definition of suspected cases and clinical diagnosis). In addition, following the recording of WNV infection cases in an area, local Health Units are urgently informed. In addition, regarding the timely notification of WNV disease, active laboratory-based surveillance is established, including the daily communication and information exchange between the NPHO and laboratories conducting diagnostic testing for WNV; thus, all WNV diagnosed cases are notified to the national level (and further investigated) within 24 hours after their diagnosis.

Regarding Section V: Mosquito surveillance and control is under the responsibility of the regional and/or municipal authorities, who outsource integrated mosquito control programmes to private contractors through a tender. The National Public Health Organization (NPHO)/MoH) and the Benaki Phytopathological Institute (BPI)/Ministry of Rural Development and Food also conduct active mosquito surveillance programmes in a limited scale. 

Regarding question 28d: A total number of 522 sentinel adult mosquito surveillance sites for the 2021 season has been estimated including all traps included to the planned surveillance protocols of both the national and regional authorities; 
i. approximatelly 465 sites for adult mosquitoes' traps either from the regional authorities (according to their plan for 2021, a few still in ongoing call for tenders procedure) or (for a total of 157 traps) from the collaboration of regional and national authorities [including 72 sites in collaboration of Regions and NPHO, 65 sites in collaboration of one Region and the Benaki Phytopathological Institute (BPI), and 20 sites in collaboration of NPHO, BPI and one Region], and
ii. 57 additional sites for adult mosquitoes' traps of the NPHO (still in ongoing call for tenders procedure).
In addition, 110 sites for ovitraps (for Aedes mosquitoes) are placed from the BPI in collaboration with one Region. 
Larval/ pupal mosquito surveillance (or other ovitraps for Aedes mosquitoes placed by regional authorities) are conducted only by the regional authorities and information about the number of these sites is not available at the national level.

Regarding question 30: Larval/ pupal mosquito surveillance is conducted only by the regional authorities.

Regarding question 33: Testing for specific arboviruses on mosquito pools is performed in University/academic institutions, funded mainly by national and regional public health authorities (and ad hoc by EU programmes).

Regarding question 35: The method of sterile insect release has been implemented for 3 years as a pilot programme by the Benaki Phytopathological Institute in collaboration with the International Atomic Energy Agency.

Regarding question 39: No routine surveillance for monitoring resistance of Aedes invasive mosquito species to the insecticides used is conducted at the national level. Some surveys are conducted in Universities and/or Institutions. To our knowledge, for Aedes invasive mosquito species, there is no conclusive evidence of resistance to insecticides in the field so far.

Regarding question 55: Only imported cases of Dengue, Chikungunya, and Zika have been recorded in Greece (a total of 18 imported cases of Dengue, 5 imported cases of Chikungunya and 5 imported cases of Zika have been recorded in Greece during the period 2015-2020).

Regarding question 59: 
- In Greece there is full epidemiology and laboratory capacity for the Arboviruses surveillance; however, this is achieved with a high workload of the available staff. So, in this question, we have included the ideal number of staff persons needed (to conduct the surveillance with an adequate workload). 
- Mosquito surveillance and control programmes are under the responsibility of regional and municipal authorities. NPHO (MoH) and Benaki Phytopathological Institute (Ministry of Rural Development and Food) also conduct active mosquito surveillance programmes in a limited scale. Regarding the iv. sub-category: As in Greece no Aedes-borne transmission has been recorded, Aedes circulation is routinely monitored in several areas in the context of the abovementioned mosquito surveillance programmes (and urgently around the recorded imported human cases of Aedes-borne diseases, if needed). The capacity on epidemiologists (for human and animal health sectors), entomologists/ vector control specialists and support staff only at the national level (in Ministries, NPHO, BPI) is included in this answer, and not at regional/local level, as the staff needed for capacity building at the regional/local level cannot be easily assessed at the national level. However, the capacity of the regional authorities regarding the human resources (on human, animal and vector arboviral surveillance staff) is limited and needs enhancement in every sector (human and animal and vector surveillance).

In Armenia the only case of Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) in humans was registered in 1974, which ended with a death of a young zoologist. During the 1986-1996 entomological survey, the CCHF virus was found in ticks in different regions. In 2016 CCHF virus antigen was detected from 6 tick species.
Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) virus was historically diagnosed in Armenia but has not been studied in recent years. Investigations carried out in 1985-1992, showed TBE virus circulation among bloodsucking arthropods’ species found in almost all landscape zones of the country. Natural foci of TBE were identified in various climatic and geographical zones.
Available literature indicates Sandfly fever was reported in Armenia until the late 1970s. Phlebotomine shadflies are found in different altitudes of the country.  Pappataci fever was found mostly in visitors (24 times more than in residents) in Ararat valley and Southern part of Armenia. Currently, no cases of Sandfly fever are registered in Armenia due to lack of diagnostic capacities and awareness of medical personnel. 
West Nile fever is now spread all over the world, including the Mediterranean, causing high mortality. It is transmitted by the bites of Culex, the species widely spread in Armenia. 
Aedes albopictus and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes have been found in the territories bordering Armenia. A VectorNet (European Network of entomologists & public health specialists) field mission of Armenia in 2016 identified 29 different species of mosquitoes, including 6 anophelines, 10 aedes, 3 culiseta, 8 culex, 1 uranotaenia and 1 coquilletidia, including Aedes albopictus for the first time in the northern part of Armenia (bordering to Georgia). Aedes albopictus (Stegomyia albopicta), also known as Asian tiger mosquito, was recorded in a single locality, at the border point with Georgia, on the main road Tbilisi-Yerevan. Routine entomological surveillance (conducted by field entomologists working in NCDC branches) in 2017-2020 on the presence/absence of Aedes invasive species revealed expansion of the area of Aedes albopictus. This important potential vector of many arboviruses was recorded during the four consecutive years 2016-2020. Field observations demonstrate Aedes albopictus’s recent introduction and establishment in the north of the country, with implications for public health. More comprehensive studies are required to understand the real distribution of Aedes albopictus in Armenia, to estimate and predict the future distributions of it in response to target surveillance and control efforts that aim to mitigate the spread of arboviral diseases among the population.

Medical recorders from EWARS sites are provided regular training on notification of dengue cases integrated with trainings for all EWARS listed other 5 diseases.

The national guidelines for dengue has a specific section on disease surveillance and has categorized dengue disease as suspected, probable and confirmed for notification purposes. 118 EWARS sentinel sites are reporting dengue cases through this platform.

Barriers/Challenges: Dengue cases are categorized into suspected (clinically), probable (based on RDT both antigen and antibody detection) and confirmed cases (PCR OR Viral Culture, OR IgM seroconversion in paired sera OR IgG seroconversion in paired sera OR four fold IgG titer increase in paired sera). Mostly diagnosis are made clinically or based on RDT. Due to availability of various kind of RDTs in the country and health workers not using the right kind of RDT at the right point of time during illness, there are many false positive or false negative cases. Since there is no WHO-PQ RDT for the national program to procure, RDTs from various companies are used at the peripheral level. This has impacted in disease surveillance.
