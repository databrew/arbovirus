# Overview

This repository consists of a data analysis pipeline of the World Health Organization, built in collaboration with [Databrew LLC](https://databrew.cc). It contains code for processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from a global arbovirus survey. The below instructions lay out how a developer can (a) prepare her repository for analysis by setting up data, (b) generate an analytical webpage / dashboard, (c) generate a "simplified" dataset for further analysis, and (d) generate a missingness report for operational and data collection monitoring.

# Developer instructions

## Setting up data

- Start by cloning this repository (if needed, instructions for cloning a repository from github are available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
- Once you've got the repository on your local machine, in the main repo, create a folder named `data`. Populate it with the files in `data.zip` sent to you directly.
- Source `prepare_data.R` to create `data.RData`, `combined_data.RData`, and the simplified dataset `simplified_dataset.csv`. 
- The contents of your `arbovirus` `data` folder should now look like this:

```
# tree
data
├── combined_data.RData
├── Copia_de_PAHO_key_indicator_spreadsheet_19_Nov_2021-Completo.xlsx
├── Country_level_summarized_responses.csv
├── Data_dictionary_Survey375147.csv
├── data.RData
├── PAHO_countries.csv
├── Regions_Countries.csv
├── region_shp.rda
├── results-survey375147.csv
├── simplified_dataset.csv
├── survey_375147_R_data_file.csv
├── survey_375147_R_syntax_file.R
├── who_afro.csv
├── who_shp.RData
└── world_shp.rda
```

## Generating the global dashboard

- Change to the directory `dashboard` and set it as your working directory.
- Open `create_pages.R` in RStudio.
- Make sure that line 7 is commented out and that line 8 is _not_ commented out:

```
# regions <- "EMRO"
regions <- c("AMRO","EMRO","EURO","SEARO","WPRO")
```

(Line 7 might show a region other than "EMRO", but it should be commented out.)

- Source `create_pages.R`.
- Run `rmarkdown::render_site`.
- Using a web browser, open any of the `.html` pages in `dashboard/_WHOA` to launch the global dashboard.

## Generating a regional dashboard

- Change to the directory `dashboard` and set it as your working directory.
- Open `create_pages.R` in RStudio.
- Make sure that line 8 is commented out and that line 7 is _not_ commented out:

```
regions <- "EMRO"
# regions <- c("AMRO","EMRO","EURO","SEARO","WPRO")
```

- Change line 7 to specify the desired region; "EMRO" is shown here as an example.
- Source `create_pages.R`.
- Run `rmarkdown::render_site`.
- Using a web browser, open any of the `.html` pages in the directory determined by the desired region (`dashboard/_AMRO`, `dashboard/_EMRO`, `dashboard/_EURO`, `dashboard/_SEARO`, or `dashboard/_WPRO`) to launch the regional dashboard.

## Generating missingness reports

- Open `missingness/missing.Rmd` in Rstudio  
- Follow the instructions in `missingness/instructions.md`
