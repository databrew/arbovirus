# Overview

This repository consists of a data analysis pipeline of the World Health Organization, built in collaboration with [Databrew LLC](https://databrew.cc). It contains code for processing, analyzing, and visualizing data from a global arbovirus survey. The below instructions lay out how a developer can (a) prepare her repository for analysis by setting up data, (b) generate an analytical webpage / dashboard, (c) generate a "simplified" dataset for further analysis, and (d) generate a missingness report for operational and data collection monitoring.

# Developer instructions

## Setting up data

- Start by cloning this repository (if needed, instructions for cloning a repository from github are available [here](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)).
- Once you've got the repository on your local machine, in the main repo, create a folder named `data`. Populate it with the files in `data.zip` sent to you directly.
- In the main repo, create a folder named `misc`. Populate it with the files in `misc.zip` sent to you directly.
- The contents of your `arbovirus` folder should look like this:

```

```

## Generating a dashboard

- Open `dashboard/index.Rmd` in Rstudio  
- Click the "knit" button
- A deploy-ready dashboard will be created in `dashboard/_site`. It can be explored by opening `dashboard/_site/index.html` in a web browswer  


## Generating a simplified dataset

- `cd` into the `dashboard` directory, then source a suite of functions/utilities by running:

```
source('app_functions.R')
```
- Then, run the following in R:

```
simple <- load_data(modify_variable_names = TRUE)
readr::write_excel_csv(simple, '~/Desktop/simplified_dataset.csv')
```

The above will write a file to your desktop of "simplified" data.


## Generating a dashboard

- Open `missingness/missing.Rmd` in Rstudio  
- Follow the instructions in `missingness/instructions.md`  
- A deploy-re will be created in `dashboard/_site`. It can be explored by opening `dashboard/_site/index.html` in a web browswer
