# Instructions for updating the missingness analysis

You should have received the following files via email:
- `missingness.Rmd`
- `Data_dictionary_Survey375147.csv`
- `survey_375147_R_syntax_file.R`

Download the latest version of `survey_375147_R_data_file.csv` from the WHO by exporting the 
survey responses in the **R (data file)** format. **Put all 4 of these files in the same directory.**

Open RStudio. You'll need to install 2 packages, `tidyverse` and `flextable`, before 
running the missingness analysis.  Once those packages have been installed, open `missingness.Rmd` and
click the `Knit` button at the top of the file. If you haven't done this before, RStudio will 
ask if you want to install a bunch of packages so that knitting will work; say yes to the prompt and be patient 
while the packages are installed. 

Knitting `missingness.Rmd` should work now, and the updated missingness analysis should appear momentarily!
If you have any problems, let us know and we'll sort them out as soon as possible.
