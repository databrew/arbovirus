#### Criteria for declaring an outbreak and vector control measures that are deployed in emergencies (ref Q49, 51)

```{r}

colnames( q49 ) <- c("Response", "Comments")
q49 <- cbind(Country=data$SI01, q49) %>%
  mutate( Response = recode_factor(.x = Response,
                                   "Yes. If so, in the comments field, please briefly describe the criteria or reference the document in which those are sta"="Yes",
                                   "No"="No",
                                   "I don’t know"="I don’t know")) %>%
  mutate( across( everything(), as.character) ) %>%
  mutate( across( everything(), replace_na, "") ) %>%
  unite( "Criteria for outbreak declaration", Response:Comments, sep="\n") 

q51 <- get_responses("51") %>%
  rename( "Emergency vector control measures" = Response)

cbind( q49, q51 ) %>%
  regulartable( ) %>% 
  theme_zebra(odd_header="#048ECA", odd_body = "#D6EAF8") %>% 
  color( color="#FFFFFF", part="header" ) %>% 
  autofit()
