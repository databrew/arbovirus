For reference, here are the relevant definitions:
\end{quote}

\textbf{Active surveillance} is defined as having dedicated systems and
staff that routinely and with effort survey for cases of disease or
detection of vectors and associated pathogens by the public health
department.

\textbf{Passive surveillance} is defined as having a reporting system
where physicians, laboratories, mosquito control districts, academic
institutions or others routinely report cases of disease or detection of
vectors and associated pathogens to the public health department.
