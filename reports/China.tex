\begin{quote}
For reference, here are the relevant definitions:
\end{quote}

\textbf{Active surveillance} is defined as having dedicated systems and
staff that routinely and with effort survey for cases of disease or
detection of vectors and associated pathogens by the public health
department.

\textbf{Passive surveillance} is defined as having a reporting system
where physicians, laboratories, mosquito control districts, academic
institutions or others routinely report cases of disease or detection of
vectors and associated pathogens to the public health department.

In China, there are infectious disease hospitals at the provincial and
municipal levels, and infectious diseases departments are esablished in
county level hospitals, which are responsible for the treatment of
diseases transmitted by Aedes. Currently, mosquito borne diseases are
not the main public health burden in most areas, and these diseases are
managed by related infectious disease doctors and general practitioners.
The Centers for disease control at all levels are responsible for
epidemiological investigation and laboratory testing. There are endemic
areas of dengue fever all year round, and the hospital laboratory
department also undertakes the corresponding testing work.
